Training the Model: Data is trained in Teachable Machine and exported in SavedModel (TensorFlow format).
Setting Up PyCharm: A Python project is created in PyCharm with a virtual environment.
Installing Dependencies: TensorFlow is installed using the terminal in PyCharm.
Importing the Model: The exported model is added to the PyCharm project directory after extracting the ZIP file.
Interpreting Results: Predictions are interpreted and mapped to labels used in Teachable Machine.
This project demonstrates how to train, export, and utilize a custom machine learning model offline using TensorFlow in PyCharm.
